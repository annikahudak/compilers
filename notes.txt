//The file must start with the words:
Welcome to CPSC-402!

//this next part is a joke
// [David Tyler enters having just gotten off plane]

//Lines follow with brackets. these serve to initialize variables with values
//if students enter with a MAC, they are initialized to 1, if they enter with a PC, initialized to -1
//as students enter, they are added to an array of struct(Student) which we will create:
// struct Student {
//	char* name,
//	int val
//}

[Student Name enters with a MAC] // 1, add student to array of students

[Student Bonk enters with a PC] // -1, add student to array of students

//calculations begin once DT says:
David Tyler:
	Good morning! Any tech news?

//Raises hand = increment the student's value by 1
//adverbs (words with "ly") following action multiply by 2 per adverb
//Cough = decrement the student's value by 1
Student_Name:
	(Raises hand slowly & surely) // add 1 and multiply by 4, "ly" = *2
	(Raises hand) // add 1
	Hello im saying things and things are happening to you.

Student_Bonk:
	(Causes a disturbance loudly) // multiply by 2. action is ignored bc its not a keyword for us
	I am also doing that.
	(Coughs) // decrement 1

StudentName:
	(Leaves classroom) // Student removed from array

BonkBonk:
	(falls asleep) // this could be something
	(Charges laptop at front of room) // this could too

(StudentName highfives BonkBonk) // StudentName = StudentName + BonkBonk

(BonkBonk punches Student Name) // BonkBonk = BonkBonk - StudentName

(BonkBonk mutters) // print the integer value held by BonkBonk
(Student Name yells) // print the alphanumeric (ASCII/Hexadecimal) value held by Student_Name -- this allows us to print strings)

--------------------------------------------------------

To DO:

1. Figure out putting new variables into the array
2. All value changing methods (increment by 1, decrement, multiply by 2)
3. Add variables values to each other, subtract variable values from each other
4. Print int
5. Print string

implementation:
--> move through lines in file
	if the line is a variable name: curr_variable = variable name
----> go word by word through line
-------> if word is "RAISES_HAND" : increment curr_variable by 1
-------> else if word is "COUGHS" : decrement curr_variable by 1
-------> else if word ends in "ly" : multiply curr_variable by 2
