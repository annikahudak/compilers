//The file must start with the words:
Welcome to CPSC-402!

//The next portion is a "roster" of students, whose names are the variables that will be used in the program
Roster:
	Student_Name
	Student_Bonk
	BonkBonk

//this next part is a joke
// [David Tyler enters having just gotten off plane]

//Lines follow with brackets. these serve to initialize variables with values
//if students enter with a MAC, they are initialized to 1, if they enter with a PC, initialized to -1
//as students enter, they are added to an array of struct(Student) which we will create:
// struct Student {
//	char* name,
//	int val
//}

[Student Name enters with a MAC] // 1, add student to array of students

[Student Bonk enters with a PC] // -1, add student to array of students

//calculations begin once DT says:
David Tyler:
	Good morning! Any tech news?

//Raises hand = increment the student's value by 1
//adverbs (words with "ly") following action multiply by 2 per adverb
//Cough = decrement the student's value by 1
Student_Name:
	(Raises hand slowly & surely) // add 1 and multiply by 4, "ly" = *2
	(Raises hand) // add 1
	Hello im saying things and things are happening to you.

Student_Bonk:
	(Causes a disturbance loudly) // multiply by 2. action is ignored bc its not a keyword for us
	I am also doing that.
	(Coughs) // decrement 1

StudentName:
	(Leaves classroom) // Student removed from array

BonkBonk:
	(falls asleep) // this could be something
	(Charges laptop at front of room) // this could too

(StudentName high fives BonkBonk) // StudentName = StudentName + BonkBonk

(BonkBonk laughs at Student Name) // BonkBonk = BonkBonk - StudentName

(BonkBonk mutters) // print the integer value held by BonkBonk
(Student Name yells) // print the alphanumeric (ASCII/Hexadecimal) value held by Student_Name -- this allows us to print strings)
